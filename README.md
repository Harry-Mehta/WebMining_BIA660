# WebMining_BIA660

In this course, I have learned how to extract data
from the web and analyze web-scale data using distributed computing,
different analysis methods that are widely used across the range of internet
companies, from start-ups to online giants like Amazon or Google. 

Additional learning objectives include the development of:
Data collection and preprocessing skills: how to identify and profile
candidate sources of valuable data, as well as how to automatically collect and manage
the information they need for their analytics tasks.

Diverse Analytic Skills: students will be exposed to a wide range of both quantitative
and qualitative analytics techniques with applications across multiple business
domains.

Team Skills: the students will be organized in teams and collaborate on projects for the
duration of the course. Each student will evaluate his/her teammates twice during the
semester via a customized team survey tool. The tool provides a detailed analysis of a
personâ€™s contributions to the different stages of the team
